## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

## Optimizations
*function code block repitition to get comfortable with javaScript*

## Lessons Learned:

Learned that everything commmented out will not affect the speed & optimization on a site. With the codeblock re-written and commented out a dozen times, I was worried
that it may affect the speed. This allowed me to get more comfortable with adding comments to each of my steps in future projects and work.  
Learned that with practice can come perfect. One step closer to perfecting the foundations of user interaction. 

Impletementing eventListeners and functions.
